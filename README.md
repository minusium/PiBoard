# Piboard
Piboard is a Persian virtual keyboard for Nokia Asha phones.

Notice that Nokia Asha has Persian in some variants, or you can flash a firmware with Persian support.

I have flashed my phone to the latest firmware manually and the latest doesn't have Persian,
I'm not able to flash another version, because it's older and the Nokia Rescure Tools doesn't let me downgrade.
I don't have a Box so I can't use other tools like Phoenix to flash my phone,
so I decided to write this program, so with that I can send SMS and Email in Persian, with Share API,
I can keep them in my Phone's Messager Program.

# Build
Use Nokia IDE (Eclipse) with Nokia Asha SDK 1.2 to build this.
